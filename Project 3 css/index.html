        <h2>What is Treaty 1?</h2>
        <div>
          <!-- Introduction content for Treaty 1 -->
          <p>
            Treaty 1 was the first of the numbered treaties signed in Canada. It
            was an agreement between the government of Canada and various First
            Nations. The treaty was signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort
            Garry, which is near present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Canadian government was represented by officials, including the
            Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, Adams G. Archibald. First Nation
            leaders for the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and the Cree included Peguis,
            Sandy Bay, Brokenhead, and Long Plain First Nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Canadian government wanted to open up the land for settlement
            and the construction of railways. First Nations leaders signed the
            treaty to protect their land, receive annual payments, and obtain
            farming tools and other essentials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government promised land of 160 acres per family of five, annual
            payments, and tools to work on farms. The First Nations did not cede
            their ownership but agreed to share the land, believing they would
            coexist peacefully with settlers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all promises of the treaty were kept. Resources and support
            promised to the First Nations were often not received. Many
            misunderstandings arose due to language differences and varied
            interpretations of the treaty's meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treaty 1 remains relevant today, symbolizing the bond shared by the
            Canadian government and First Nations people. Many continue to
            advocate for treaty rights and the rectification of past wrongs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding Treaty 1 helps us learn about Indigenous history and
            culture, highlighting the importance of cooperation and respect for
            agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Treaty 1 is often referred to as the
            <span class="highlight"> Selkirk Treaty</span> because it
            encompasses the area of the Selkirk Settlement.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The signing of Treaty 1 marked the beginning of a series of treaties
          that would significantly alter the relationship between Indigenous
          peoples and the Canadian government. While it was intended to promote
          peace, the treaty has been criticized for its implementation and the
          subsequent marginalization of Indigenous communities.
